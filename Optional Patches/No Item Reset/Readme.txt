If you apply this patch, you will not lose your current augs when you start a run. This means you can use BetterRuns to set your level to 0 and play a complete run with whichever augs you wish (Freeplay mode). Without this patch, the game would strip you of all your stuff and you'd begin a regular run.




WARNING: This patch will cause the following minor issues:

1. At the start of level 1, a visual glitch will occur when your character warps into the stage. Instead of only appearing after the warp animation, your character is already standing there before the animation is finished. (This also happens in the unmodified game when you load a save state, by the way.)

2. If you wall-slide before entering the teleporter to level 1, you will temporarily lose the ability to wall-slide in level 1. Your character will simply not stick to walls when you jump at them. Your ability to wall-slide will usually come back after a few seconds, however, I have come across seeds (usually when Agnisort was level 1) where your wall-slide ability only came back once the game timer reached 1:51. But like I said, as long as you restrain yourself and don't wall-slide in the HQ (or in the level 0 teleporter room when using a modified save state), everything will be fine.

3. When you start up the game and enter the HQ for the first time, your character might be invisible! Just switch to another character to resolve this issue.


(If you experience any other reproducible issues, please let me know.)
