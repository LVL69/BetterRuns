How to use this editor:

1. In 20XX, save the game at the end of a stage. This will create a save state of your run ("20xx.run").
2. EXIT THE GAME (otherwise changes you make in the editor won't take effect).
3. In the editor, click the button "Open 20xx.run file".
4. Select your save state in C:\Users\(Your user name)\Documents\20XX
5. Go crazy.
6. Click button "Save" and overwrite your old save state.
7. Go crazy again.
